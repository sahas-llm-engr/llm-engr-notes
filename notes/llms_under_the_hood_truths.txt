Absolutely. Below is a **compiled, practical list of “under-the-hood truths” about LLMs**—things that materially affect behavior, cost, reliability, and system design, but are rarely obvious from the UI.

I’ll group them so they’re easy to absorb and reuse.

---

# 🧠 Under-the-Hood Truths About LLMs

## 1. Tokens, Not Words, Are the Real Currency

* Models **think, bill, and limit** in tokens.
* Short text can be expensive; long text can be cheap.
* Common words = fewer tokens; rare/compound words = more tokens.

**Implication:** Prompt engineering is mostly **token engineering**.

---

## 2. Models Don’t “See” Messages — They See One Long String

* System + developer + user messages are concatenated internally.
* Order and phrasing strongly influence behavior.
* Earlier text has more influence than later text.

**Implication:** Put constraints **early**, not at the end.

---

## 3. Instructions Compete With Each Other

* Conflicting instructions are resolved probabilistically, not logically.
* “Be concise” vs “Explain in detail” is not an error—just tension.

**Implication:** Fewer, clearer rules beat many clever ones.

---

## 4. The Model Has No Concept of Truth

* It predicts *what sounds right*, not *what is right*.
* Confidence ≠ correctness.
* Citations can be fabricated unless verified externally.

**Implication:** LLMs need **grounding** (tools, retrieval, validation).

---

## 5. Memory Is Not Persistence

* “Conversation memory” ≠ database.
* Context window ≠ long-term recall.
* Once text falls out of the window, it’s gone.

**Implication:** Important facts must be **re-injected** or stored externally.

---

## 6. “Temperature” Is Controlled Randomness, Not Creativity

* Low temperature → deterministic, conservative
* High temperature → varied, riskier
* It does **not** make the model “smarter”

**Implication:** Use temperature for **style**, not correctness.

---

## 7. The Model Doesn’t Reason — It Simulates Reasoning

* Chain-of-thought is a *generated artifact*, not actual logic.
* Correct answers can come from flawed reasoning and vice versa.

**Implication:** Trust **outputs**, not explanations.

---

## 8. Longer Prompts Can Make Answers Worse

* Over-specification dilutes signal.
* Important instructions can be “lost” in noise.

**Implication:** Clarity beats completeness.

---

## 9. Negative Instructions Are Weak

* “Do NOT do X” is less effective than “Only do Y”.
* The model still internally represents “X”.

**Implication:** Use **positive constraints**.

---

## 10. The Model Is Extremely Sensitive to Framing

* “You are an expert” works
* “You are bad at this” also works
* Tone primes behavior heavily

**Implication:** Role assignment is a powerful lever.

---

## 11. Models Learn Patterns, Not Rules

* They don’t execute algorithms unless prompted carefully.
* Edge cases are especially fragile.

**Implication:** For logic-heavy tasks, add **structure** (steps, schemas).

---

## 12. Hallucinations Increase With:

* Ambiguous questions
* Rare topics
* Long-tail facts
* Requests for citations
* Overconfidence prompts

**Implication:** Ask for **uncertainty disclosure** explicitly.

---

## 13. The Model Can Be Steered by Examples More Than Instructions

* One good example > five paragraphs of rules.

**Implication:** Use **few-shot prompting** whenever possible.

---

## 14. “Random” Isn’t Random

* Same prompt + same seed → same output.
* Different phrasing → radically different outputs.

**Implication:** Prompt wording is a form of programming.

---

## 15. Safety Filters Operate Outside the Model

* Refusals aren’t “decisions”
* They’re enforced layers

**Implication:** Model behavior ≠ system behavior.

---

## 16. Models Don’t Know What They Don’t Know

* They won’t say “I don’t know” unless trained or instructed.
* Silence feels worse than guessing.

**Implication:** Explicitly request **confidence levels or uncertainty**.

---

## 17. The Model Optimizes for Helpfulness Over Precision

* It will fill gaps to be useful.
* Partial information gets completed.

**Implication:** In high-stakes domains, constrain output tightly.

---

## 18. Formatting Changes Meaning

* Bullet points ≠ paragraphs
* Tables ≠ prose
* Code blocks drastically alter behavior

**Implication:** Output format is part of the prompt.

---

## 19. Models Are Better at Editing Than Creating

* Fixing, summarizing, refactoring > inventing
* “Improve this” beats “Create from scratch”

**Implication:** Seed the model whenever possible.

---

## 20. Cost, Latency, and Quality Trade Off

* Larger models = better reasoning, slower, more expensive
* Smaller models = faster, cheaper, less reliable

**Implication:** Match the model to the task.

---

# 🧩 Meta Truth (The Big One)

> **LLMs are not AI employees — they are probabilistic text engines that can simulate expertise when constrained correctly.**

Most failures come from treating them like humans instead of **systems**.

---

## If you want, next I can:

* Map these truths to **real production failures**
* Show **before/after prompts** demonstrating each one
* Create a **LLM design checklist** for teams
* Explain which truths matter most for **startups vs enterprises**

Just tell me where you want to go next.
